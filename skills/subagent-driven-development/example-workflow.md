# Subagent-Driven Development: example workflow

A worked session, moved out of [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) to keep the skill body under
the 20,000-character re-attach cap.

```
You: I'm using Subagent-Driven Development to execute this plan.

[Setup: worktree verified]
[Read plan file once: docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md]
[Resolve workspace: bash scripts/sdd-workspace docs/superpowers/plans/feature-plan.md — no ledger inside, fresh start]
[Create todos for all tasks]

Task 1: Hook installation script

[Write the note; run dispatch implementer PLAN_FILE 1 --note NOTE; dispatch with the printed one-line prompt]

Implementer: "Before I begin - should the hook be installed at user or system level?"

You: "User level (~/.config/superpowers/hooks/)"

Implementer: [Later]
  - Implemented install-hook command
  - Added tests, 5/5 passing
  - Self-review: Found I missed --force flag, added it
  - Committed

[Run dispatch reviewer PLAN_FILE N BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed one-line prompt]
Task reviewer: Spec ✅ - all requirements met, nothing extra.
  Strengths: Good test coverage, clean. Issues: None. Task quality: Approved.

[Ledger: Task 1: complete (commits a1b2c3d..d4e5f6a, review clean)]

Task 2: Recovery modes

[Write the note; run dispatch implementer PLAN_FILE 2 --note NOTE; dispatch with the printed one-line prompt]

Implementer: [No questions]
  - Added verify/repair modes
  - 8/8 tests passing
  - Committed

[Run dispatch reviewer PLAN_FILE N BASE HEAD; dispatch task reviewer with the printed one-line prompt]
Task reviewer: Spec ❌:
  - Missing: Progress reporting (spec says "report every 100 items")
  Issues (Important): Magic number (100)

[Fix round 1: resume the implementer with both findings]
Implementer: Added progress reporting, extracted PROGRESS_INTERVAL constant.
  Re-ran test/recovery.test.js — 10/10 passing. Fix report appended.

[Run dispatch re-review PLAN_FILE 2 FIX_BASE HEAD --note FINDINGS; dispatch scoped re-review]
Re-reviewer: Missing progress reporting — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:41).
  Magic number — ADDRESSED (src/recovery.js:7). New breakage: none.
  Verdict: all findings addressed.

[Ledger: Task 2: fix round 1/5 (2 addressed, 0 open; commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e)]
[Ledger: Task 2: complete (commits d4e5f6a..b7c8d9e, review clean)]

...

[After all tasks]
[Run dispatch final PLAN_FILE MERGE_BASE HEAD --note NOTE; dispatch final code-reviewer, most capable model]
Final reviewer: All requirements met. Deferred minors triaged: none block merge.

[Delete this plan's workspace — the record now lives in git]

Done! Using superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch.
