# Subagent-Driven Development: the pre-flight scan

The full procedure for the scan that [SKILL.md](SKILL.md)'s Setup section asks
for before Task 1. Moved here to keep the skill body under the 20,000-character
re-attach cap; it runs once per plan.

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts, writing down
what you checked as you check it:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

The scan's output is a table, not a verdict. One row for every pair of tasks
that share a file or an interface: the two tasks, what one produces against
what the other consumes, and what you found. One row for every task: whether
its own text agrees with itself — the tests it specifies against the code it
specifies, the files it creates against the files it later touches. "The scan
is clean" without those rows is not a scan you ran.

Write the table to the ledger. Rule on everything you find before execution
begins — each finding against the plan text that mandates it — and record
each ruling in the ledger. If the scan is clean, proceed without comment.
Rule on each conflict it surfaces — the spec is the binding authority, the
plan is its argument — record the ruling beside its row, and dispatch
Task 1. The review loop remains the net for conflicts that only emerge from
implementation.
